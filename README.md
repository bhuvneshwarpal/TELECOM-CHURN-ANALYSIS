# Project Title:

TELECOM-CHURN-ANALYSIS
# Problem Statement: 

Dataset is provided by Orange S.A., formerly France Telecom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's churn dataset consists of cleaned customer activity data (features) along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.
The main objective is to explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention. 


# Approach

In the first part of EDA the data frame is evaluated for structure, columns included and data types. The goals of this step are to get a general understanding for the data set, check domain knowledge and get first ideas on topics to work on.
While performing the Exploratory data analysis we evaluated different factors that lead a customer to churn. We performed various graphical techniques to identify the interdependence of different features to each other. Heat Maps helped us in understanding the correlation of each other in a very numerical way.
Some significant evaluations are:
We have lost approximately 15% (14.5%) of our subscribers as per the given data set. 
We have WV as a state with maximum number of subscribers and CA with minimum number of subscribers.
NY is in top three performing states but still have high churning rate ~18% 

# Conclusion :

After evaluating every aspect of it we got some very deep insights that lead the customer to terminate their account and get churned. Some of the evaluations are:-
The customers with higher numbers of customer service calls have a very high probability of getting churned.
High billing causes customers to get churned.
Customers who are getting churned have high "total day minutes" with low “customer service calls”.
Customers who have high "total day charge" leads to churn
Customers with low "total charge" but they call the customer service more are also terminating their account.
Subscribers having international plans are churning more.
